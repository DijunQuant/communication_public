# communication_public

The repository contains a the code for simulation (communication_sim.ipynb) and analyzing empirical data (communication_empirical.ipynb) from the Midnight Scan Club. 
For the detailed rationale of the emthods, see manuscript "From correlation to communication: disentangling hidden factors from functional connectivity changes" by Yuhua Yu, Caterina Gratton, Derek M. Smith. 

The developement of the simulation code benefits from Ito et al., (2020) (https://github.com/ito-takuya/HemodynamicResponseModeling).
